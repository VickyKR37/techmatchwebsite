TechMatch is an app which allows people who are in or want to get into the tech industry to find a mentor in the tech industry. You can register on the app as either a mentor or a mentee. To be both you need to register with separate email addresses for the two modes. The mentee can scroll through the mentor’s profiles and then apply to be a mentee with an unlimited number of mentors. It is then up to the mentor to accept or reject the mentee. It is mandatory to give feedback with any and every rejection. The app consists of a sign up page, a login page, a forgot password page, a page where you select whether you are a mentor or a mentee, a profile creation page, a profile page, a search for mentors page, a messages page (with the beginning of all new messages) and a message page with a selected, single users messages.
